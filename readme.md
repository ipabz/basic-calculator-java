This code is a Java implementation of a simple calculator application with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using the Swing library. Here's a breakdown of the code:

Imports: The necessary classes are imported, including javax.swing.* for the GUI components, java.awt.* for layout and color classes, and java.awt.event.* for handling user events.

Class Declaration: The Calculator class extends JFrame (a top-level window container) and implements the ActionListener interface to handle button clicks.

Instance Variables: Various instance variables are declared, including the text field for displaying the input/output, a StringBuilder for storing the input, variables for operands and operators, and colors for the GUI components.

Constructor: The Calculator constructor sets up the GUI components and layout. It creates a JTextField for displaying the input/output, a JPanel for holding the buttons, and adds the buttons to the panel with their respective labels and action listeners. The layout is set using BorderLayout, and the window is centered on the screen with a fixed size.

Event Handling: The actionPerformed method is implemented from the ActionListener interface. It handles the button clicks by checking the action command and performing the corresponding operation (clear, calculate, set operator, or append to input).

Helper Methods:

- clear(): Resets the calculator state by clearing the input, operands, and operator.
- calculate(): Performs the calculation based on the current operands and operator.
- setOperator(String op): Sets the operator for the next calculation.
- appendToInput(String str): Appends the given string to the input StringBuilder.

Main Method: The main method creates an instance of the Calculator class and makes it visible using SwingUtilities.invokeLater to ensure the GUI is created on the Event Dispatch Thread (EDT).

The code creates a calculator GUI with a display field and buttons for digits, operators, and special functions like clear (AC) and equals (=). The user can enter numbers, select operators, and perform calculations. The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) and handles error cases like division by zero.

The GUI has a dark color scheme with customized colors for the background, buttons, and text. The buttons also have a hover effect to provide visual feedback when the user hovers over them.

Overall, this code demonstrates the use of Swing components, layout managers, event handling, and basic arithmetic operations to create a functional calculator application with a graphical user interface.# basic-calculator-java
